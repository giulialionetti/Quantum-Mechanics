Graph 1: Individual Energy Eigenstates
These show the actual wavefunctions for the first 5 energy levels (n=1 through n=5).

Blue line = the wavefunction ψ(x) itself (it can be either positive or negative and has no physical meaning)
Red line = probability density |ψ(x)|² -> has physical meaning, expresses the probability of finding the particle

Key pattern:

n=1: No nodes (zeros) inside the box - ground state
n=2: 1 node at the center
n=3: 2 nodes
n=4: 3 nodes
n=5: 4 nodes

Physical meaning: Higher energy = more oscillations = more "wiggly" the wavefunction

Graph 2: Ground State |n=1⟩
Left plot (Energy Basis):

Bar chart showing |c_n|² for each energy level
Only one bar at n=1 with height 1.0
Meaning: The particle is 100% in the ground state, 0% in any other state

Right plot (Position Basis):

Shows where the particle is likely to be found in space
Peaked in the center of the box
Zero at the walls (boundary condition)
Meaning: Most likely to find the particle near x=0.5 (middle of box)

This is the SAME quantum state, just viewed in two different ways!

Graph 3: Superposition (|n=1⟩ + |n=2⟩)/√2
Left plot (Energy Basis):

Two bars of equal height at n=1 and n=2
Each has probability 0.5 (50% chance in each state)
Meaning: The particle is in a quantum superposition of two energy levels

Right plot (Position Basis):

More complex shape than pure ground state
Asymmetric - higher probability on the left side
Meaning: Interference between the two sine waves creates this pattern
You're more likely to find the particle on the left side of the box

Key insight: When you combine two energy states, you DON'T just add their probabilities - you add the wavefunctions first (which can interfere), THEN square to get probability.

Graph 4: Localized Gaussian Packet
This is the most interesting one!
Top-left (Energy Basis - All States):

Many energy levels contribute (not just one or two)
Peaks at lower n, tapers off for higher n
Meaning: To create a localized "bump" in space, you need to combine MANY energy eigenstates

Top-right (Energy Basis - First 10):

Zoomed in view of the most important contributors
States n=1 through n=7 contribute significantly

Bottom-left (Position Basis):

Green = what we wanted (Gaussian bump centered at x=0.3)
Red dashed = reconstruction from energy eigenstates
They overlap perfectly! ✓
Meaning: We successfully decomposed a localized particle into energy eigenstates

Bottom-right (Wavefunction Real Part):

Shows the actual wavefunction (not squared)
Blue = original, Red = reconstructed
Shows the oscillations that create the Gaussian envelope

Physical story:
Imagine you prepare a particle localized near x=0.3. In energy language, this means the particle is simultaneously in states n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5... with different amplitudes. The more energy states you include, the more precisely localized it becomes in position.
This illustrates the uncertainty principle!

Well-defined position (narrow Gaussian) → many energy states
Well-defined energy (single n) → spread out in position


Graph 5: Orthonormality Check
The matrix shows ⟨m|n⟩ - the overlap between different energy states.

Diagonal (m=n): All 1.00 → each state is normalized
Off-diagonal (m≠n): All 0.00 → different states are orthogonal

What this means:

Different energy eigenstates don't "overlap" - they're completely independent
This is why we can uniquely decompose ANY wavefunction into energy eigenstates
Mathematical basis: these states form a complete orthonormal basis

Visual: Only the diagonal is red (value=1), everything else is blue (value=0) - perfect identity matrix!

The Big Picture
All these graphs demonstrate change of basis:

Energy basis {|n=1⟩, |n=2⟩, |n=3⟩...} ← Good for time evolution (each evolves independently)
Position basis {|x⟩} ← Good for where the particle is

Same quantum state, two perspectives:

|ψ⟩ = Σ c_n |n⟩  (energy language)
ψ(x) = Σ c_n ψ_n(x)  (position language)

The coefficients c_n tell you "how much" of each energy eigenstate is in your state!
