Restrictions of non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics:

## Space and time are treated differently

- space is an operator (the position operator)
- time is just a parameter (t)

Unlike special relativity, where they are unified in the space-time uniquum

- No relativistic effects -> Ek=1/2mv^2 << E0 = mc^2

This condition states that the kinetic energy of the particle (i.e when the particle is in motion) is much smaller than the rest mass energy.

What does this implicate?

v << c -> Particles move slower than light -> in Non relativistic quantum mechanics we can use Ek without loss of generality

The Schrödinger equation applies (both time dependent and time independent)

- Particles with mass
this excludes photons and other massless particles

The asymmetric treatment of time and space has consequences:

- Time is not an observable, therefore it can't be "measured"
 (there is no such thing as an eigenvalue equation made of "time eigenstates" corresponding to time "eigenvalues")

 **Time of arrival problem: When does a particle reach a detector? Hard to define rigorously**

- Time is external to the system, it governs its evolution. The evolution is completely deterministic, unlike the outcome of the experiments which has always an inherent randomness. The randomness of the outcomes is NOT caused by time evolution.

Starting point:

Light exhibites diffraction/interference properties and therefore wave-like properties.

## interference

Interference is the phenomenon where two or more waves overlap in space, and their amplitudes combine to produce a resultant wave with a different intensity pattern than either wave alone.
The Mathematical Principle
When two waves ψ₁ and ψ₂ meet at the same point, the total wave is:

ψtotal=ψ1+ψ2\psi_{\text{total}} = \psi_1 + \psi_2ψtotal​=ψ1​+ψ2​
This is called the superposition principle — waves add linearly.
The intensity (what we actually measure/observe) is proportional to:

I∝∣ψtotal∣2=∣ψ1+ψ2∣2I \propto |\psi_{\text{total}}|^2 = |\psi_1 + \psi_2|^2I∝∣ψtotal​∣2=∣ψ1​+ψ2​∣2

However, it also behaves like a particle in the photoelectric effect.

Electrons shot from an electron gun show diffraction as well, therefore,in a specific set up of the experiment, they exhibit wave-like properties.

Diffraction is the phenomenon where waves bend around obstacles or spread out after passing through openings (apertures), deviating from straight-line propagation.
It occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or opening whose size is comparable to the wavelength of the wave.

When electrons "show diffraction," it means they're spreading out and creating interference patterns after passing through slits or scattering off crystals —

However, a change in the set up of the experiment demonstrates that they are actually particles.

Quantum mechanics reconciles this through:
The wavefunction ψ(x,t):

Propagates like a wave (satisfies Schrödinger equation, shows interference)
Collapses to particle-like detection events (|ψ|² gives probability of finding particle at position x)

The de Broglie relations unify both pictures:

E = ℏω (energy ↔ frequency)
p = ℏk (momentum ↔ wave vector)

So every quantum object has both an energy/momentum (particle properties) and a frequency/wavelength (wave properties) simultaneously.

## In Quantum Mechanics, both the wave-like and the particle-like behaviour must be taken into account. This duality is the reason why they exhibit randomness -

| **Diffraction** | **Interference** |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Single wave encountering an obstacle/opening | Multiple waves overlapping |
| Wave spreads/bends | Waves add (constructively or destructively) |
| Fundamental wave property | Consequence of superposition |

so...
Light waves, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, radio waves

what makes them subject to diffraction (which they all show)?

## they satisfy the superposition principle
