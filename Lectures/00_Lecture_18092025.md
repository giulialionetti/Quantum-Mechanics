# Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics

## Restrictions and Foundational Principles

### Space and Time Are Treated Differently

- **Space** is an operator (the position operator **x̂**)
- **Time** is just a parameter (t)

This is unlike special relativity, where space and time are unified in the spacetime continuum.

### No Relativistic Effects

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \ll E_0 = mc^2$$

This condition states that the kinetic energy of the particle (when in motion) is much smaller than the rest mass energy.

**What does this implicate?**

- **v ≪ c** → Particles move much slower than light
- In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, we can use the classical kinetic energy formula without loss of generality
- The Schrödinger equation applies (both time-dependent and time-independent)

### Particles With Mass

This framework excludes photons and other massless particles.

## Consequences of Asymmetric Treatment of Time and Space

### Time Is Not an Observable

- Time cannot be "measured" as a quantum observable
- There is no eigenvalue equation made of "time eigenstates" corresponding to time "eigenvalues"
- **Time of arrival problem**: When does a particle reach a detector? This is hard to define rigorously.

### Time Is External to the System

- Time governs the evolution of quantum systems
- Evolution is completely **deterministic**
- The outcome of experiments has inherent **randomness**
- The randomness of outcomes is **NOT** caused by time evolution

## Wave-Particle Duality: The Starting Point

Light exhibits diffraction/interference properties and therefore wave-like properties. However, it also behaves like a particle in the photoelectric effect.

Electrons shot from an electron gun show diffraction as well. In a specific setup of the experiment, they exhibit wave-like properties. However, a change in the setup demonstrates that they are actually particles.

## Key Wave Phenomena

### Interference

**Interference** is the phenomenon where two or more waves overlap in space, and their amplitudes combine to produce a resultant wave with a different intensity pattern than either wave alone.

**The Mathematical Principle:**

When two waves ψ₁ and ψ₂ meet at the same point, the total wave is:

$$\psi_{\text{total}} = \psi_1 + \psi_2$$

This is called the **superposition principle** — waves add linearly.

The **intensity** (what we actually measure/observe) is proportional to:

$$I \propto |\psi_{\text{total}}|^2 = |\psi_1 + \psi_2|^2$$

### Diffraction

**Diffraction** is the phenomenon where waves bend around obstacles or spread out after passing through openings (apertures), deviating from straight-line propagation.

It occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or opening whose size is **comparable to the wavelength** of the wave.

When electrons "show diffraction," it means they're spreading out and creating interference patterns after passing through slits or scattering off crystals.

### Diffraction vs. Interference

| **Diffraction** | **Interference** |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Single wave encountering an obstacle/opening | Multiple waves overlapping |
| Wave spreads/bends | Waves add (constructively or destructively) |
| Fundamental wave property | Consequence of superposition |

## Quantum Mechanical Reconciliation

### In Quantum Mechanics, both wave-like and particle-like behavior must be taken into account.

This duality is the reason why quantum systems exhibit randomness.

Quantum mechanics reconciles wave-particle duality through:

**The wavefunction ψ(x,t):**
- Propagates like a wave (satisfies the Schrödinger equation, shows interference)
- Collapses to particle-like detection events (|ψ|² gives the probability of finding a particle at position x)

**The de Broglie relations unify both pictures:**
- E = ℏω (energy ↔ frequency)
- p = ℏk (momentum ↔ wave vector)

So every quantum object has **both**:
- Energy/momentum (particle properties)
- Frequency/wavelength (wave properties)

simultaneously.

## What Makes Waves Subject to Diffraction?

Light waves, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and radio waves all show diffraction.

**Why?**

### They satisfy the superposition principle

This is the fundamental property that allows waves to exhibit interference and diffraction phenomena.
